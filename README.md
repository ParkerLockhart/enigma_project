#### Self Assessment

*Functionality:*
Meets expectations 
  - Enigma Class with encrypt and decrypt methods successfully implemented. 
  - Encrypt/decrypt command line interfaces successfully implemented. 

*OOP*
Meets expectations
  - Project is broken into logical components that are appropriately encapsulated. 
  - No classes are unreasonably small or large, or contain knowledge/information/behavior that they shouldn’t know about. 
  - Student can articulate the single responsibilities of the various components.

*Ruby conventions and mechanics*
Meets expectations
  - Code is mostly properly indented, spaced, and lines are not excessively long. 
  - Class, method, variable, and file names follow convention. 
  - Some enumerables/data structures chosen are the most efficient tool for a given job, and students can speak as to why those enumerables/data structures were      chosen. 
  - At least one hash is implemented in a way that makes logical sense.

*Test driven development*
Meets expectations
  - Every method is tested at both the unit and integration level, and completely verify expected behavior (i.e., if a single method does 3 things, all 3 things are explicitly tested). 
  - Obvious edge cases are addressed. 
  - Git history demonstrates students are writing tests before implementation code. 
  - Test coverage metrics show coverage at 99% or greater.
